# Vital-Signs-mmWave-sensor
The project utilizes a 60 GHz pulsed coherent radar sensor, the XM112 radar, for non-invasive and contactless vital signs monitoring. Signal processing techniques extract accurate vital sign information, offering improved healthcare efficiency and continuous monitoring with data transmission to the cloud for analysis and archival.
